# autostove

Script to regulate my ecoforest stove :
- Using external source of temperature
- Using more clever regulating logic than swiping between min power and max power ; for example with power range of 1..9 (my stove), putting 4 "all the time" to maintain the expected temperature, and avoid to put 9 then 1, then 9 then 1...

Use at your risks (stove = fire = danger)
